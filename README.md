## Why would I want that?

Perhaps you'd like
to generate a report
containing sprauncy visualizations
of your website's performance.
Or maybe you want
to analyse all of the raw data behind
WebPageTest's median-based summaries
using a spreadsheet.

This tool can help you
do both of those things.
It can also be extended
to map WebPageTest result data
into any conceivable format.

## What formats does it support?

Three data mappers
are provided
out of the box:
`html-comparison`,
`html-distribution` and
`odf-spreadsheet`.

### html-comparison

The `html-comparison` mapper
generates an HTML document
containing three sections:

1. A table
   summarising the salient metrics
   for each test.
   Each data cell in the table
   links to the equivalent results page
   on the WebPageTest instance.
   The page-title cells
   link to the page under test.
2. SVG charts
   that draw comparisons
   between various aspects
   of the test results.
   These charts are rendered
   from static markup,
   so will display correctly
   even if JavaScript is disabled
   in the viewer's web browser.
3. A table
   summarising the optimization scores
   that WebPageTest awards
   to each page.
   Each data cell
   in this table
   links to the optimization details.

Throughout the document,
tests are identified
consistently by colour,
to help readers
track trends
from section to section.

### html-distribution

The `html-distribution` mapper
generates an HTML document
containing SVG histograms
that show the distribution of data.
There is one histogram
per metric
per test.

Each bar on the histogram
represents a standard deviation
from the mean.
The bars
for data
less than the mean
are coloured green
and the ones
for figures
greater than mean
are red.

### odf-spreadsheet

The `odf-spreadsheet` mapper
generates an Open Document Format (ODF) spreadsheet.

For each test,
a table is created
in the spreadsheet
which breaks down
the salient metrics
for every run.
At the bottom of this table,
a number of functions are applied
to help show the distribution
of the data.

## Can I specify other formats?

Yes.
Mappers are loaded
with `require`,
using a two-pass approach
that enables
custom extensions
to be invoked.

Initially,
mappers are speculatively loaded
from the `src/mappers` sub-directory
of the base installation.
If that effort throws,
a second attempt is made
to load them
from the specified module path
verbatim.
Thus,
standard mappers
are loaded
at the first attempt
and custom extensions
are loaded
at the second attempt.

Mappers are called
with two arguments,
`options` and `results`.
They should return
an ES6-compatible promise
representing the mapped result.

Consult
the [standard mapper implementations][mappers]
for more information.

## How do I install it?

If you're using npm:

```
npm install webpagetest-mapper --global
```

Or if you just want the git repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:nature/webpagetest-mapper.git
```

## How do I use it?

### From the command line

The executable name
is `wptmap`.

For command-line help,
run:

```
wptmap --help
```

Available options are:

* `--uri <URI>`:
  Base URI
  of the WebPageTest instance.
  The default is `www.webpagetest.org`.
* `--key <key>`:
  Your WebPageTest API key.
* `--location <location>`:
  The WebPageTest location.
  The default is `Dulles:Chrome`.
* `--connection <connection>`:
  The WebPageTest connection speed.
  The default is `Native Connection`.
* `--tests <path>`:
  Path to the
  [test definitions file][testdefs].
  The default is `tests.json`.
* `--count <number>`:
  The number of times
  to run each test.
  The default is `9`.
* `--email <address>`:
  The email address to notify
  when tests are finished.
* `--wait <interval>`:
  The number of seconds
  to wait between
  attempts to fetch
  result data.
  The default is `600`
  (10 minutes).
* `--output <path>`:
  File to write the mapped data to.
  The default is stdout.
* `--dump <path>`:
  Path to a file,
  in which to dump
  intermediate results
  for later processing.
  Use this option
  if you need to run
  the same result data
  through more than one mapper.
* `--results <path>`:
  Path to the
  intermediate results file,
  previously dumped
  using `--dump`.
  This option skips
  actually running the tests
  and re-uses result JSON
  from earlier runs.
* `--resultIds <ids>`:
  Fetch results from WebPageTest
  using the comma-separated list
  of result ids
  and skip running the tests.
  Use this option
  when you want to map data
  from pre-existing
  WebPageTest runs.
* `--mapper <path>`:
  The mapper to use.
  The default is `html-comparison`.
* `--silent`:
  Disable logging.
  Overrides `syslog`.
* `--syslog <facility>`:
  Send log data to syslog,
  using the specified facility level.
* `--config <path>`:
  Attempt to read configuration options
  from a JSON file.
  The default is `.wptrc`.
  Click [here][eg-config]
  for an example
  config file.

### From a node.js project

Import the library
using `require`:

```javascript
var wpt = require('webpagetest-mapper');
```

Three functions are exported
from the main module:
`fetch`,
`map` and
`run`.
They each
take an options object
as their first argument and
return an ES6 promise
representing their result.

#### fetch (options)

`fetch` asynchronously invokes WebPageTest
and returns an ES6 promise
that resolves to
the following data structure:

```javascript
{
    data: [ ... ],      // Result array from WebPageTest
    options: { ... },   // Cloned options object normalised with default values
    times: {
        begin: { ... }, // JavaScript Date instance representing the start time
        end: { ... }    // JavaScript Date instance representing the finish time
    }
}
```

The returned promise
is only resolved
when all of the tests
have completed.
It is never rejected.

Instead,
if any tests fail,
the equivalent item
in the `results.data` array
will have a property
named `error`
which contains
the `Error` instance.
Handling errors in this way
prevents rogue network issues
from failing an entire run,
while still propagating error information
for inspection by the caller.

`fetch` accepts
an options object
as its only argument,
supporting the following properties:

* `uri`:
  Base URI
  of the WebPageTest instance.
  The default is `www.webpagetest.org`.
* `key`:
  Your WebPageTest API key.
* `location`:
  The WebPageTest location.
  The default is `Dulles:Chrome`.
* `connection`:
  The WebPageTest connection speed.
  The default is `Native Connection`.
* `tests`:
  Path to the test definitions file or an array of test definitions.
  The default is `tests.json`.
* `count`:
  The number of times
  to run each test.
  The default is `9`.
* `wait`:
  The number of seconds
  to wait between
  attempts to fetch
  result data.
  The default is `600`
  (10 minutes).
* `email`:
  The email address to notify
  when tests are finished.
* `resultIds`:
  Array of WebPageTest result ids
  to use instead of
  actually running the tests.
* `dump`:
  Dump intermediate results
  to file.
* `silent`:
  Disable logging.
  Overrides `syslog` and `log`.
* `syslog`:
  Send log data to syslog,
  using the specified facility level.
  Overrides `log`.
* `log`:
  Logging implementation.
  Needs the functions
  `log.info()`,
  `log.warn()` and
  `log.error()`.
* `config`:
  Attempt to read configuration options
  from a JSON file.
  The default is `.wptrc`.

##### Example

```javascript
wpt.fetch({
    uri: 'example.com',
    location: 'London:Firefox',
    tests: path.join(__dirname, 'tests.json'),
    count: 25,
    silent: true
}).then(function (result) {
    result.data.forEach(function (datum, index) {
        var id = '#' + index + ' [' + datum.name + ']';

        if (!datum.error) {
            return console.log('Test ' + id + ' passed: ' + datum.id);
        }

        console.log('Test ' + id + ' failed, reason: ' + datum.error.message);
    });
});
```

#### map (options, results)

`map` is not asynchronous
but still returns a promise,
to maintain consistency
with the rest of the API.

The value of the promise
is dependent on
the result of
the specific mapper
that is invoked.
Of the built-in mappers,
`html-comparison` returns a string
containing the document markup and
`odf-spreadsheet` returns a `Buffer` instance
containing the binary content.

This promise will be rejected
if an error is thrown
from the mapper.

`map` accepts
an options object
as its first argument,
supporting the following properties:

* `results`:
  Read results object
  from file.
* `mapper`:
  The mapper to use.
  The default is `html-comparison`.
* `silent`:
  Disable logging.
  Overrides `syslog` and `log`.
* `syslog`:
  Send log data to syslog,
  using the specified facility level.
  Overrides `log`.
* `log`:
  Logging implementation.
  Needs the functions
  `log.info()`,
  `log.warn()` and
  `log.error()`.
* `config`:
  Attempt to read configuration options
  from a JSON file.
  The default is `.wptrc`.

The second argument
to `map`
is a results object,
in the format
returned by `fetch`.

##### Example

```javascript
wpt.map({
    mapper: 'odf-spreadsheet',
    silent: true
}, results).then(function (mapped) {
    fs.writeFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'results.ods'), mapped);
}).catch(function (error) {
    console.log(error.stack);
});
```

#### run (options)

`run` combines
the actions from
`fetch` and `map`,
asynchronously invoking WebPageTest
and returning a promise
that represents the mapped data.

It accepts
an options object
as its only argument,
supporting the aggregated properties
from `fetch` and `map`.

##### Example

```javascript
wpt.run({
    uri: 'example.com',
    location: 'London:Firefox',
    tests: path.join(__dirname, 'tests.json'),
    count: 25,
    mapper: 'odf-spreadsheet',
    silent: true
}).then(function (mapped) {
    fs.writeFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'results.ods'), mapped);
}).catch(function (error) {
    console.log(error.stack);
});
```

## What is the format of the test definitions file?

This is
a very basic
JSON file
containing
an array
of test objects.

Each test object
supports three properties,
`name`, `url` and `type`:

* The `name` property
  forms the basis of
  the WebPageTest label
  and is used
  to identify tests
  in the output
  from all mappers.

* The `url` property
  is passed to WebPageTest
  as the URL to test
  and is also
  linked to
  in the output
  from the `html-comparison` mapper.

* The `type` property
  is used
  to differentiate tests
  in the output
  from the `html-comparison` mapper.
  Currently
  it supports the values
  `home` and `away`,
  but these are open
  to change
  with feedback
  from more widespread usage.

for an example
test definitions file.

## Is there a change log?

[Yes][history].

## How do I set up the dev environment?

The dev environment relies on
node.js,
[JSHint],
[Mocha],
[Chai],
[Mockery] and
[Spooks].
Assuming that you already have node and NPM set up,
you just need to run `npm install` to
install all of the dependencies as listed in `package.json`.

You can lint the code
with the command `npm run lint`.

You can run the unit tests
with the command `npm test`.

## What versions of node.js does it support?

0.12 or greater

## What license is it released under?
